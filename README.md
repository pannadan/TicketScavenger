## What is this?
Retirement Calculator is a React tool that was developed for the HackTX Hackathon in the ACM for change challenge and Capital One challenge. 
It is a tool that employees can use to calculate their retirement funds based on their personal information including type of retirement account, monthly contributions to the fund, company matching, APY for the account, and more. 
Based on the calculation, the tool will respond and give you a pat on the back or suggest ways on how you can better meet your retirement goals.
